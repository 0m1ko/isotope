<p class="tagline">Isotope: An exquisite jQuery plugin for magical layouts</p>

## Features

+ **Layout modes**: Intelligent, dynamic layouts that can't be achieved with CSS alone.
+ **Filtering**: Hide and reveal item elements easily with jQuery selectors.
+ **Sorting**: Re-order item elements with sorting. Sorting data can be extracted from just about anything.
+ **Interoperabilty**: features can be utilized together for a cohesive experience.
+ **Progressive enhancement**: Isotope's engaging animations take advantage of the best CSS transition and transform features when available, but also fall back to Javascript animation for lesser browsers.
